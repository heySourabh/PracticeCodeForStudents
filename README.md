# PracticeCodeForStudents
Some code for students to practice on

This folder contains a Makefile, so running "make" at the command line will compile the code.

If you do not have make-tools then you can run the command:

gcc -Wall *.c -I./include -lm -o output.exe

I have tested the code only on Ubuntu 16.04.
On other distributions of Linux it should have no problems.

For windows using Visual Studio will most probably work, as there are no dependences on non-standard libraries.
