# PracticeCodeForStudents
Some code for students to experiment with, and program the solvers taught in the class.

To understand the code start by looking at the algorithm (in comments) written in [main.c](https://github.com/heySourabh/PracticeCodeForStudents/blob/master/src/main.c)  file.

This folder contains a [*`Makefile`*](https://github.com/heySourabh/PracticeCodeForStudents/blob/master/Makefile), so running `make` at the command line will compile the code. If you do not have [make-tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) installed, then you can run the following command:

`gcc -Wall *.c -I./include -lm -o output.exe`

I have tested the code only on Ubuntu 16.04.
Nevertheless, on other distributions of Linux it should have no problems.

For Windows using Visual Studio will most probably work, as the code uses only standard libraries.

Here is a plot of a solution generated by the code (the [plotting program](https://github.com/heySourabh/PracticeCodeForStudents/blob/master/plotSolution.py) is included):
